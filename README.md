# Flocks - coding about birds

Experiments using OPENRDR to think about birds, and likely a diary of what up.

Longer writeups (eventually) up at https://flowerses.gay

## Initial setup

Making sure I am comfortable with Kotlin and the package is correctly set, plus adding a trivial agent moving around.
Goals - make sure I have a screen up and running and an agent moving around in 2d space. mess with colors, trails and mouse input.
Ideally, also create a utilities package providing colors/palettes and other useful stuff. Eventually, move agents and other common stuff to a package as well.
